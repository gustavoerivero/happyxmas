This code consists of displaying on the console a Merry Christmas message next to a Christmas tree and the song "Feliz Navidad" 8-bit version.

The code was written in Python language and Playsound was used to reproduce the "Feliz Navidad" 8-bit version.

The song must be in the same place as the happyxmas.py file for it to work smoothly.

You need to install the Playsound dependency. For this you can use the command "pip install playsound".

Without further ado, Merry Christmas to all.
